README for version $Name$

Flexible backup script.
I did this to to help automate my life.

Looked at many other packages/scripts and didn't really find anything
that worked the way I wanted it to. For my needs I felt the existing 
packages I looked at at were any combination of:
   o Too complex to setup/use
   o Lacked documentation
   o Too simplistic
   o Didn't have features I wanted
   
Flexbackup's features:
   o Easy to configure
   o Uses dump, afio, tar, or cpio with the flick of a switch
   o It's just perl
   o Full (0) and 1-9 levels of incremental backup
   o Filesystem-oriented (won't traverse devices)
   o Does remote backups too
   o Works with IDE/SCSI tapes or Linux ftape
       ftape allows table of contents support

Software needed:
   o perl 
   o mt (or ftmt if using ftape)
   o one or more of
       dump/restore afio tar cpio
   o possibly ftape and ftape-tools
   
   
Notes:
 Level 0 backups assume a new tape - will trigger
 tape retension and erasure.  Other level dumps move tape to
 current end of data and start the dump there

 rsh or ssh is used for remote bakcups

 Log files are of the format <prefix><fs>.<level>.<yyyymmdd>
 Lower-level dumps will wipe out all higher-level log files in
 the log directory for that filesystem.
