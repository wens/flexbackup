Version 0.9.3 (19990921) (just for testing)

 - can now archive to files instead of devices
     just set $device to a directory for backup
     compare/extract/list/restore can now take a filename argument
 - timestamp changes:
     use "touch -t" not "touch -d" so FreeBSD works
     all dates now in YYYYMMDDhhmm.SS format
     dump can use /etc/dumpdates or flexbackup's timestamps
     use timestamps of the epoch for level 0 (simplifies code)
 - add "-d var=val" for overriding config values
 - if $dump_length set to 0 use dump -a
 - tar mode uses "find" just like afio & cpio
 - afio doublebuffering option
 - FreeBSD fix for mt setblk
 - error if level > 0 and no level 0 stamp exists
 - fix label string for remote paths
 - add -n option that doesn't run mt and the actual backup

Version 0.9.2 (19990920)

 - initial release to the public
 - gzip log files option
 - fix afio buffer to be in units of k in cfg file

Version 0.9.1 (1999019)

  - incrementals w/ afio cpio tar done (remote fs too!)
  - timestamp only after sucessful backup, but use the pre-backup time
  - noerase option

Version 0.8

  - redone with "use strict"
  - incremental for non-dump types almost done
  - automated pacakging
  - clean some duplicated code
  - rpm build, lsm file
  - previously just a local hack I had done for myself
