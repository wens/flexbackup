# Default backup type: "afio", "dump", "tar", or "cpio"

# List the filesystems you wish to dump when "all" is given
# Just a simple space-separated list
# Remote filesystems should denoted as "host:dir"
#
# Example:
#   $filesystems = "/ /usr /home /usr/local machine1:/usr machine2:/home";
#
$filesystems = "/ goliath:/";

# Device to dump to (non-rewinding)
# if a directory, archive to files in that directory rather than a device

# Block size (k) to use for the device (default for most devices is 10)

# Command to use for remote shells (rsh or ssh)
