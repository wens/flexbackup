      I keep getting only one backup per tape when I do "-fs all"!
      </I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Use the non-rewinding device.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <LI><I>
      I can't get the $exclude_expr stuff to work!
      </I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Use regular expressions, not wildcards (aka globs).  See a perl, sed,
      or grep reference, or "man 7 regex".  Simplistically, you probably
      mean to say ".*" instead of "*", and ".?" instead of "?".  Also,
      leave OFF the first part of a path that is the filesystem you
      are archiving;  the exclude epxressions only match sub-paths of
      the backup directory. Test to see if your expression matches what
      you want to exlude by:
      <PRE>
      cd &lt;topdir&gt;
      find . -regex "&lt;expression&gt;"
      </PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      How do I archive multiple filesytems at once without redefining $filesystems
      in the configuration file?
      </I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Do this:
      <PRE>
      flexbackup -fs /dir1 -norewind
      flexbackup -fs /dir2 -norewind
      flexbackup -fs /dir3 -norewind
      </PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <LI><I>
      The disk totally died.  How do I get flexbackups' archives off the
      tapes on a mchine without the flexbackup script installed?
      </I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Something like this, if using compression with
      tar/cpio/dump:
      <PRE>
      dd if=/dev/tapedevice bs=10k | gzip -dc | tar xvf -
      </PRE>
      replace "tar xvf -" with "restore -i -f -" or whatever. Skip the gzip
      pipe if you aren't using compression.  afio is a bit more compex, but
      read the manpage...

  <LI><I>
      This index stuff is a useless mess/I can't get it to work!
      </I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Set $indexes = 'false' in the config.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

 <LI><I>
      I don't have the index files! (disk died, different machine, etc)
      </I>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      This is OK, you can still extract/restore/etc. The index files are
      for human convenience only.  Just skip the first file on the tape,
      it's a simple "tag" text file.  The rest of the tape is your normal archives.
