README for version $Name$

Flexible backup script.
I did this to to help automate my life.

Looked at many other packages/scripts and didn't really find anything
that worked the way I wanted it to. For my needs I felt the existing
packages I looked at at were any combination of:
   o Too complex to setup/use
   o Lacked documentation
   o Too simplistic
   o Didn't have features I wanted

Flexbackup's features:
   o Easy to configure (at least I think so)
   o Uses dump, afio, tar, or cpio with the flick of a switch
   o It's just perl
   o Full (0) and 1-9 levels of incremental backup
   o Filesystem-oriented (won't traverse devices)
   o Does remote backups too
   o Works with IDE/SCSI tapes or Linux ftape
       ftape allows table of contents support

Software needed:
   o perl
   o mt (or ftmt if using ftape)
   o one or more of
       dump/restore afio tar cpio
   o possibly ftape and ftape-tools

Install:
   o Copy flexbackup.conf to /etc
   o Put the flexbackup program someplace in your PATH
   o Edit flexbackup.conf as desired. See the comments

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use:  See "flexbackup -help". Examples below

To do a full backup of /home:
   flexbackup -fs /home

To do an level 5 incremental dump of all filesystems:
   flexbackup -fs all -level 5

For nightly incremental dumps, run this via cron:
   flexbackup -fs all -level 9

Restore all files from archive into current directory:
   (position tape w/mt - use logs to find filenum or block)
   flexbackup -extract

Notes:
 Level 0 backups of "all" assume a new tape - will trigger
 tape retension and erasure.  Other backups move tape to
 current end of data and start the backup there

 rsh or ssh is used for remote backups.  Backups of remote machines
 are to be run from the machine with the tape drive!

 Log files are of the format <prefix><fs>.<level>.<yyyymmdd>
 Lower-level dumps will wipe out all higher-level log files in
 the log directory for that filesystem.
