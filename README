README for version $Name$

Flexible backup script.

Features:
   o Easy to configure (at least I think so)
   o Uses dump, afio, tar, or cpio with the flick of a switch
   o Backup, extract, compare, list modes
   o Full (0) and 1-9 levels of incremental backup
   o Filesystem-oriented (won't traverse devices)
   o Does remote filesystems (over rsh/ssh; no special service)
   o Works with IDE/SCSI tapes on Linux/FreeBSD
     or Linux ftape (allows table of contents support)
   o Nice log files

Software needed:
   o perl
   o mt (or ftmt if using ftape)
   o one or more of
       dump/restore afio tar cpio
   o possibly ftape and ftape-tools

Install:
   o Copy flexbackup.conf to /etc
   o Copy the flexbackup program to someplace in your PATH
     You only need to do this on the machine with the tape drive -
     remote machines don't need anything installed
   o Edit /etc/flexbackup.conf as desired. See the comments

I looked at many other packages and didn't really find anything that
worked the way I wanted it to.  For my needs I felt the existing
packages were any combination of:
   o Too complex to setup/use
   o Lacked documentation
   o Nonstandard archiving formats
   o Overkill for a small network of 2 or 3 machines
   o Too simplistic, or hard-coded assumptions
   o Didn't have features I wanted

----------------------------------------------------------------------

USE:
See "flexbackup -help". Examples below.

To do a full backup of /home:

   flexbackup -fs /home

For nightly incremental backups, run this via cron:

   flexbackup -fs all -level 9

To do a full backup of /usr from machine "otherhost", forcing cpio type:

   flexbackup -fs otherhost:/usr -type cpio

To do an level 5 incremental backup of all filesystems:

   flexbackup -fs all -level 5

Extract all files from current tape position into current directory:

   flexbackup -extract

Compare afio archive at current tape position with the /home
filesystem on machine "otherhost":

   flexbackup -compare otherhost:/home -type afio

Notes:
 Level 0 backups of "all" assume a new tape - will trigger
 tape retension and erasure.  Other backups move tape to
 current end of data and start the backup there

 rsh or ssh is used for remote backups.  Backups of remote machines
 are to be run from the machine with the tape drive!

 Log files are of the format <prefix>.<fs>.<level>.<yyyymmdd>
 Lower-level backups will wipe out all higher-level log files in
 the log directory for that filesystem.

 I suggest using either the "dump" or "afio" types.  Dump would be
 perfect if it did compression... afio is a good bet if you want
 compression - one error will not corrupt your entire archive like
 with a compressed tar scheme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I did this to to help automate my life.
See the TODO list for what I might be planning to do next
