NAME
     mt - magnetic tape control

SYNOPSIS
     mt [ -f _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e ] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d...  [ _c_o_u_n_t ]

DESCRIPTION
     mt sends commands to a magnetic tape drive.  If -f  _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e
     is not specified, the environment variable TAPE is used.  If
     TAPE does not exist, mt uses the device /dev/rmt/0n.

OPTIONS
     -f _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e    Specify the raw tape device.

OPERANDS
     _c_o_u_n_t          The number of times that the requested opera-
                    tion  is to be performed. By default, mt per-
                    forms _c_o_m_m_a_n_d once;  multiple  operations  of
                    _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may be performed by specifying _c_o_u_n_t.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d        Available commands that can be sent to a mag-
                    netic tape drive.  Only as many characters as
                    are required to uniquely identify  a  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                    need be specified.

                    eof, weof      Write _c_o_u_n_t EOF marks  at  the
                                   current position on the tape.

                    fsf            Forward space over  _c_o_u_n_t  EOF
                                   marks.  The tape is positioned
                                   on  the  first  block  of  the
                                   file.

                    fsr            Forward space _c_o_u_n_t records.

                    bsf            Back  space  over  _c_o_u_n_t   EOF
                                   marks.  The tape is positioned
                                   on the beginning-of-tape  side
                                   of the EOF mark.

                    bsr            Back space _c_o_u_n_t records.

                    nbsf           Back space _c_o_u_n_t  files.   The
                                   tape   is  positioned  on  the
                                   first block of the file.  This
                                   is equivalent to _c_o_u_n_t+_1 bsf's
                                   followed by one fsf.

                    asf            Absolute space to  _c_o_u_n_t  file
                                   number.  This is equivalent to
                                   a rewind  followed  by  a  fsf
                                   _c_o_u_n_t.

                    If _c_o_u_n_t is specified with any of the follow-
                    ing  commands,  the  _c_o_u_n_t is ignored and the

BUGS
     Not all devices  support  all  options.   Some  options  are
     hardware-dependent.    Refer  to  the  corresponding  device
     manual page.

     mt is architecture sensitive. Heterogeneous operation  (that
     is, Sun3 to Sun4 or the reverse) is not supported.
