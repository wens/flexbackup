Title:		Full application name - see:
		http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/NAMES

Version:	Version number - see: http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/NAMES

Entered-date:	Date of when the LSM entry was last modified.

Description:	Begin with a one line description for the database
		header.A short description of the package should follow.

Keywords: 	A short list of carefully selected keywords that describe
		the package.

Author:		author@email.address (Author's Name)
		Original author(s) of package. Email address first, followed by name in parenthesis
		Multiple persons may be given, one per line.

Maintained-by:	maintainer@email.address (Maintainer's Name).  Note this information 
		is essential.  Submissions cannot be processed without maintainer information!

Primary-site:	This should be the final location, not an "incoming" directory.
		First line lists site and base directory
		Next is the sizes and names of all files. The size can be left off.

Alternate-site: One alternate site may be given. It should not be a site that mirrors the primary site. 

Original-site:  The original package, if this is a port to Linux. 


Platforms:	Note ususual software or hardware that is required. A floppy disk or a C compiler would
		not be unusual. A Python interpreter or tape drive probably would be. If the requirements are
		evident from the description, it need not be repeated here.

Copying-policy:	 Also known as copyright information. 
		Use "GPL" for GNU Public License, 
		"BSD" for the Berkeley style of copyright, 
		"Shareware" for shareware, and some other description for other styles of copyrights.

Title:		 Fungimol
Version:	 0.2.2
Entered-date:	 2000-05-18
Description:	 Fungimol is an extensible system for designing atomic-
scale objects. The intent is to eventually extend it to be a useful
system for doing molecular nanotechnology design work. At the moment
it's a PDB file viewer and Buckminsterfullerine editor. 
Keywords:	 nanotechnology, hydrocarbon, fungimol, molecular dynamics,
pdb, pdb viewer, graphics
Author:		 tim@infoscreen.com (Tim Freeman), 
		brenner@eos.ncsu.edu (Donald Brenner)
Maintainer:	 tim@infoscreen.com (Tim Freeman)
Primary-site:	 http://www.infoscreen.com/fungimol
		2M fungimol-0.2.2-0.i386.rpm
		180K brennermd-0.1.0-0.i386.rpm
		1.1M fungimol-0.2.2-0.src.rpm
		160K brennermd-0.1.0-0.src.rpm
		1.1M fungimol-0.2.2.tgz
		168K brennermd-0.1.0.tgz
		1K fungimol.lsm
Platforms:	Built with GNU C++ compiler that supports anonymous
namespaces. g++ 2.95.2 definitely works, 2.7.0 might work, prior to
2.7.0 probably won't work. Non-GNU
C++ compiler might work too, but I haven't tried it. Also needs X
windows, 16 bits-per-pixel or more TrueColor display.
