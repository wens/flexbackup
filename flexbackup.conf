# Default backup type: "afio", "dump", "tar", or "cpio"
$type = "afio";

# List the filesystems you wish to dump when "all" is given
# Just a simple space-separated list
# Remote filesystems should denoted as "host:dir"
#
# Example:
#   push(@filesystems,"/ /usr /home machine1:/usr machine2:/home");
#
# if you want an "all" level 0 backup to span multiple tapes, add more lines
# You will be prompted for tape change in between.
#
push(@filesystems,"/ /var /usr goliath:/ goliath:/var");
push(@filesystems,"/home otherhost:/bigdisk");

# Device to dump to (non-rewinding)
# if a directory, archive to files in that directory rather than a device
$device	 = "/dev/nht0";

# Block size (k) to use for the device (default for most devices is 10)
$blksize = "64";

# Command to use for remote shells (rsh or ssh)

# Log/stamp files

# Parameters for "afio" only
$afio_buffer       = "3072";	   # amount of data to buffer (in kilobytes)
$afio_verbose      = "true";       # true to print each file as stored

# (This will trigger using ftmt rather than mt,
# add vtblc calls for table of contents, etc.)
