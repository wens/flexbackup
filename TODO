Flexbackup to-do list
Some of these might not happen, but figured I should jot them down

Cleanup/fix:
 - check filemarks/ -num / etc
 - go back trough old unread mail archive for obvious bugs etc
 - clean up all the $main:: vars, split into types
 - make path overrides also search $PATH (say if we just changed the name
     tar == gtar put still want to do normal path-seach)
 - bash PIPESTATUS trick fails if remote filesystem and shell there!=bash
     and shell local==bash. bah.

Misc:
 - make a manual page (or other enchanced doc)! too many options now :)
 - someone needs to put a bunch of stuff in a faq
 - mail lists running and used
 - Check lsm template/ibiblio.org stuff. automate
 - Try bfr or dbuffer (buffer seems unmaintained; no O_LARGEFILE)
 - Try against torture-test list:
     http://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star/testscripts/zwicky/testdump.doc.html

Features to add:
 - make remote machine path overrides possible, that supercede others
 - make -extract -files for afio/cpio/zip recurse dirs
      dump/tar already to this.
 - try restore -D for comparing subdirs w/ restore
 - interactive restore-like shell for types besides dump
      see notes below
 - some "level" that uses rpm, verifies all packages, and just backs
      up any file not in a package OR changed from a package. and the rpm list.
      once the above works make it work for debian packages
 - differential mode (all since previous higher level)
     interaction w/ logs
     interaction w/ files
     need someone to explain why they wanted this again
 - "no blocking at all" option
 - arbitratry "groups" that act sort of like "all"
 - multiple tapes for levels that aren't 0
 - extract options to not overwrite existing files
 - cd-rom burning (or just .iso type?) for full backups?
 - put .zip back in if I can make it behave
 - .zip as compression not archive type at least?  (can't unzip stdin)
 - star? (tar but w/ acl support)
 - smbtar/smbclient?
 - pax (just wraps tar/cpio)?
 - remote extract/compare/restore
      just install s/w on client w/remote tape device. need config file
      option
 - when using files
      make lower numbered level nuke higher ones & rm index?
      do I really want erase to nuke the archive files?
 - encryption with gnupg?
 - gnome driver/configurator utility
      will be a separate program that just manipulates flexbackup

-------------------

Notes for cloning restore shell for afio/tar/cpio types)
Use perl readline module
(Maybe a seperate program or module that runs off a list fed to it)

1) do a listing
2) parse & put into data structures
3) mt bsf 1
4) then give a shell w/ all commands from regular dump
5) mark things for extraction
6) reopen archive & extract that list

Help from restore to jog my brain...

        ls [arg] - list directory
        cd arg - change directory
        pwd - print current directory
        add [arg] - add `arg' to list of files to be extracted
        delete [arg] - delete `arg' from list of files to be extracted
        extract - extract requested files
        setmodes - set modes of requested directories
        quit - immediately exit program
        what - list dump header information
        verbose - toggle verbose flag (useful with ``ls'')
        help or `?' - print this list
If no `arg' is supplied, the current directory is used
