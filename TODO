Flexbackup to-do list as of version 0.9.4

Some of these might not happen, but figured I should jot them down

Features:
 - exclude regexp's
     dump won't be able to do this
 - compression for dump, cpio
     do this with the dd pipeline like I did for ssh + cpio
 - require the "buffer" utility
     use with a pipeline again
     that way we can set a global buffer size for types not just afio
     dump + ssh or dump + compress would stream better this way
 - nocompress file extension list for afio
 - arbitrary "list of files" extract
 - configurable path for programs (gtar=tar, etc)
 - support multiple tapes for a single archive
     dump already does this? maybe afio & tar I think
     Would it screw up on remote?
     Need to test with an almost-full tape.
 - use a global "title" per backup
     work in a volume label scheme
     ideas from Scott Penrose?
 - interactive restore-like shell for types besides dump
 - log files for extract/compare/etc?
 - remote extract/compare/restore
     possible at all?
     just install s/w on client w/remote tape device. need config file option
 - GUI driver/configurator utility
     "linux backup" util looked like the right kind of interface

 - cd-rom burning (or just .iso type?) for full backups?

Cleanup/fix:
 - use -print0 and make cpio,tar,afio use null terminated lists
 - resurrect my old drive and test ftape stuff again
 - check that dump dir exists
 - autodetect ftape and raw device to eliminate configuration
 - commands for backups become sequential rather than a huge
     commandline.  Use subroutine to abstract away remote command.
     Fix duplicated code in afio,cpio,tar
 - figure out dump length being multiple of blocksize problem
     manpage says one thing, behavior is another
 - figure out why I can't get dump -T to work
 - get restore to compare subdirectories of mountpoints correctly
     the mountpoint is the top of the dump archive, even if you dump a
     subdir
 - related problem to the above 2 bullets.  dump updates
     /etc/dumpdates if you dump a subdir, so if you do another
     backup of a different dir of the same fs your timestamps are hosed
 - config file in just text?  Wondering if anyone is bothered by the
     perl syntax.
