Flexbackup todo list as of version 0.9.2

Some of these might not happen, but I write them down anyway

 - FreeBSD checks out ok (hi john)
 - exclude regexp's
     dump won't be able to do this
 - resurrect my old drive and test ftape stuff again
 - autodetect ftape and raw device to eliminate configuration
 - sanity check: device perms, make sure remoteshell,vtblc,etc in path
 - config option for dump to use flexbackup timestamps or /etc/dumpdates
 - what if you try to do incrementals and no level 0 exists?
 - does restore compare subdirectories of mountpoints correctly?
 - nocompress list for afio
 - add reten switch
 - log files for extract?
 - interactive restore-like shell for types besides dump
     maybe also a "list of files" restore
 - compare/extract/restore take dir as argument 
 - transparent extract of remote volumes
 - transparent compare for remote volumes
 - transparent restore of remote volumes
     this needs to be interactive, so wont work - put sw on client
 - add disk-file based method in addiation to tape device
 - support multiple tapes for "all"
 - support multiple tapes for a single archive
 - GUI driver/configurator utility
 - handle cd-rom burning for full backups
