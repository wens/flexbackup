Flexbackup todo list as of version $Name$

Some of these might not happen, but I write them down anyway

 - blksize for tar
 - cpio (see news saved msg)
 - finish incremental support for non-dump types
 - package up nicely
 - FreeBSD checks out ok (hi john)
 - RPM spec file & LSM file
 - web page
 - announce
     freshmeat, linux-tape, comp.os.linux.announce
     submit to metalab & redhat-contrib
 - finish list, restore, compare, etc for non-dump types
 - exclude regexp's
 - full restore vs interactive restore for all types
     maybe also a "list of files" restore
 - interactive restore-like shell for other dump types
 - restore of remote volumes
 - add disk-file based method rather than device
 - suport multiple tapes for "all"
 - GUI Driver/Configurator utility
      gtk-perl
 - cd-rom burning for full backups
