Version 0.9.4

New features:
 - bzip2 option for afio and tar archives, as well as log files
 - multiple tapes for an "all" level 0.  This just lets you split up
     backups onto different tapes, not end-of-media type of
     multivolume problems (that's on the todo list)
 - support for remote dump over ssh - use dd over sn ssh pipe
 - support ssh for cpio remote backups - use dd over an ssh pipe

Bug fixes/cleanup:
 - dump -a (autosize) works now. Found my problem was a known bug.
    >>> NOTE for Linux w/dump, you MUST install dump-0.4b4-10
       (redhat lorax) or newer, or equivalent patches if you want
       dump -a to work
 - afio doublebuffer only if local backup
 - dump length bug for "-fs all"
 - get last timestamp was off-by-one
 - output of archive commands didn't go to log file
 - with label "host:path-dir"; didn't work w/ remomte + files
     labels are now "host-path-dir"
 - sanity checks in the setup, flag variables

---------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.3 (for testing only)

New features:
 - can now archive to files instead of devices
     just set $device to a directory for backup
     compare/extract/list/restore can now take a filename argument
 - add -n option that doesn't run mt or the actual backup
 - timestamp changes:
     use "touch -t" not "touch -d" so FreeBSD works
     all dates now in YYYYMMDDhhmm.SS format
     use timestamps of the epoch for level 0 (simplifies code)
 - add "-d var=val" for overriding config values
 - tar mode uses "find" just like afio & cpio
 - afio doublebuffering option

Bug fixes/cleanup:
 - FreeBSD: if $dump_length set to 0 use dump -a
 - FreeBSD: fix for mt setblk
 - error if level > 0 and no level 0 stamp exists
 - fix label string for remote paths

---------------------------------------------------------------
