Flexbackup todo list as of version 0.9.4a2

Some of these might not happen, but figured I should jot them down

 - test remote timestamps again
 - test FreeBSD again
 - recheck dump B length bug with new dump

cut off 0.9.4 here

 - exclude regexp's
     dump won't be able to do this
 - resurrect my old drive and test ftape stuff again
 - sanity check: make sure remoteshell,vtblc,afio,cpio,tar, etc in path; check dir validity
 - autodetect ftape and raw device to eliminate configuration
 - nocompress list for afio
 - arbitrary "list of files" extract
 - add reten switch

cut off 1.0 features here?

 - use a global "title" per backup
     work in a volume label scheme
     ideas & code from Scott Penrose?
 - support multiple tapes for a single archive
 - commands are an array.  use &remote_command subroutine
     abstract away duplicated code in afio,cpio,tar
 - does restore compare subdirectories of mountpoints correctly?
 - interactive restore-like shell for types besides dump
 - log files for extract/compare/etc?
 - transparent extract/compare/restore of remote volumes
     restore needs to be interactive, so wont work - put sw on client
 - GUI driver/configurator utility
     "linux backup" util looked like the right kind of interface

 - cd-rom burning (or just .iso type?) for full backups?
