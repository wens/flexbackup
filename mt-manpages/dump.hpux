       The _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p commands  copy  to  magnetic	tape  all
       files  in  the  _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m  that have been changed after a
       certain date.  This information is derived from the  files
       _/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s  and	_/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b.  _o_p_t_i_o_n specifies the
       date and other options about the dump.  _o_p_t_i_o_n consists of
       characters  from	 the set _0_1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_b_d_f_n_s_u_W_w. The _d_u_m_p and
       _r_d_u_m_p commands work only on file systems of type	 _h_f_s.  If
       the  given  file system is not of type _h_f_s, _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p
       will abort after printing an error message.

	      _0-_9	This number is	the  "dump  level".   All
			files modified since the last date stored
			in file _/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s for	the  same
			file  system  at  lesser  levels  will be
			dumped.	 If no date is determined by  the
			level,	the beginning of time is assumed.
			Thus, the option _0 causes the entire file
			system to be dumped.

	      The blocking factor is taken from the next argument
			(default is 10 if not specified).   Block
			size  is  defined  as  the logical record
			size times  the	 blocking  factor.   _d_u_m_p
			writes	logical	 records  of  1024 bytes.
			When dumping to tapes with  densities  of
			6250  BPI  or greater without using the _b
			option, the default  blocking  factor  is
			32.

	      The density of the tape (expressed in BPIs)
			is taken from the next _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.  This is
			used in calculating the	 amount	 of  tape
			used per reel.	The default value of 1600
			assumes a reel tape.

	      Place the dump on the next
			_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t file instead of  the  tape.   If
			the name of the file is _-, _d_u_m_p writes to
			the standard output.  When  using  _r_d_u_m_p,
			this  option should be specified, and the
			next argument supplied should be  of  the
			form

dump(1M)						 dump(1M)


	      Whenever	_d_u_m_p  and  _r_d_u_m_p  require operator atten
			tion, notify all users in group	 _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r
			by  means  similar  to	that described by
			_w_a_l_l(1).

	      The size of the dump tape is specified in feet.
			The number of feet is taken from the next
			_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.   When  the  specified  size is
			reached, _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p wait for reels to
			be  changed.  The default tape size value
			of 2300 feet assumes a reel tape.

	      If the dump completes successfully,
			write on file _/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s the date
			when the dump started.	This file records
			a separate date for each file system  and
			each   dump   level.	The   format   of
			_/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s is  user-readable  and
			consists  of  one  free-format record per
			line: file system name, increment  level,
			and  dump  date in _c_t_i_m_e(3C) format.  The
			file _/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s can be edited  to
			change any of the fields if necessary.

	      For each file system in
			_/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s, print the most recent
			dump date  and	level,	indicating  which
			file  systems should be dumped.	 If the _W
			option is  set,	 all  other  options  are
			ignored and _d_u_m_p exits immediately.

	      Operates like
			_W, but prints only file systems that need
			to be dumped.

       If no arguments are given, _o_p_t_i_o_n is assumed to be  and	a
       default file system is dumped to the default tape.

       Sizes are based on 1600-BPI blocked tape; the raw magnetic
       tape device must be used to approach these densities.   Up
       to  32  read  errors on the file system are ignored.  Each
       reel requires a new process;  thus  parent  processes  for
       reels  already  written	remain	until  the entire tape is
       written.

       The _r_d_u_m_p  command  creates  a  server,	_/_u_s_r_/_s_b_i_n_/_r_m_t  or
       _/_e_t_c_/_r_m_t, on the remote machine to access the tape device.

       _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p require operator intervention  for  any  of
       the following conditions:

		end of tape,
		end of dump,
		tape-write error,

dump(1M)						 dump(1M)


		tape-open error, or
		disk-read  error  (if errors exceed threshold of
		 32).

       In addition to alerting all operators  implied  by  the	_n
       option,	_d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p interact with the control terminal
       operator by posing questions requiring _y_e_s or  _n_o  answers
       when  it	 can no longer proceed or if something is grossly
       wrong.

       Since making a full dump involves  considerable	time  and
       effort,	_d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p each establish a checkpoint at the
       start of each tape volume.  If, for  any	 reason,  writing
       that volume fails, _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p will, with operator per
       mission, restart from the checkpoint after  the	old  tape
       has  been  rewound  and	removed	 and  a new tape has been
       mounted.

       _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p  periodically  report  information  to  the
       operator,  including typically low estimates of the number
       of blocks to write, the number of tapes it  will	 require,
       the  time  needed  for  completion, and the time remaining
       until tape change.  The output is verbose to inform  other
       users that the terminal controlling _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p is busy
       and will be for some time.

       The optional entries of a file's access control list (ACL)
       are not backed up with _d_u_m_p and _r_d_u_m_p. Instead, the file's
       permission bits are backed up  and  any	information  con
       tained in its optional ACL entries is lost (see _a_c_l(5)).

       In the following example, assume that the file system _/_m_n_t
       is to be attached to the file tree at the root  directory,
       (_/).  This example causes the entire file system (_/_m_n_t) to
       be dumped on _/_d_e_v_/_r_m_t_/_c_0_t_0_d_0_B_E_S_T and  specifies	that  the
       density of the tape is 6250 BPI.

       _d_u_m_p will not backup a file system containing large files.

       Tapes created from  file	 systems  containing  files  with
       UID/GIDs	 greater than 60,000 will have a new magic number
       in the header to prevent	 older	versions  of  _r_e_s_t_o_r_e(1M)
       from incorrectly restoring ownerships for these files.

       _d_u_m_p  and  _r_d_u_m_p were developed by the University of Cali
