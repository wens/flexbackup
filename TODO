Flexbackup to-do list
Some of these might not happen

Cleanup/fix:
 - Clean up more $main:: vars, split into types or refactor
 - bash PIPESTATUS trick fails if remote filesystem and shell there!=bash
     and shell local==bash. bah.
 - Check buffer avail mem thing from John
 - Revisit -cnewer problem.  Make sure it works with touch -t/-d of
     timestamp refs (ctime isn't set backward by touch like the mtime)
 - Try to use dump combined flags (for older dumps that want abc not -a -b -c)
 - When level > 9 and using files, -toc sorts it wrong (cosmetic nit)
 - When level > 9 and rm old logs/stamps, order is printed wrong (cosmetic nit)

Misc:
 - Make a manual page (or other enchanced doc)! too many options now :)
   someone made us a good start or two:
     http://myezserver.com/downloads/mitel/howto/flexbackup-howto.html
     http://www.cyber-euskadi.com/howtos/contrib/flexbackup-restore-from-disk-howto.html
 - Someone needs to put a bunch of stuff in a faq
 - Check lsm template/ibiblio.org stuff. automate
 - Try bfr or dbuffer? (buffer seems unmaintained; no O_LARGEFILE)
 - Try against torture-test list:
     http://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star/testscripts/zwicky/testdump.doc.html


Features to add:
 - Remote tape drive support
     0.9.8 patch from Caleb Crome <caleb@crome.org>
     use ssh not rmt
     could do remote dirs too...
 - non-root use (remote too)
    document sudo workaround from Alex
    maybe works using the path overrides I put in?
    sudoers:
      Defaults:backup !authenticate
      Cmnd_Alias BACKUP = /usr/bin/afio, /usr/bin/find
      backup  ALL = NOPASSWD: BACKUP
 - Make remote machine path overrides possible, that supercede others
 - Check for existence of remote executables (John had something)
 - Make -extract -files for afio/cpio/zip recurse dirs
      dump/tar already to this.
 - Try restore -D for comparing subdirs w/ restore
 - Interactive restore-like shell for types besides dump
      see notes below
 - some "level" that uses rpm, verifies all packages, and just backs
      up any file not in a package OR changed from a package. and the rpm list.
      once the above works make it work for debian packages
 - A "no blocking at all" option
 - Log tape sizes (output of buffer or dd or mt tell can be used?)
 - Handle multi-volume backups (original idea never panned out)
 - Arbitrary "groups" that act sort of like "all"
 - Extract options to not overwrite existing files
 - CD-ROM burning (or just .iso type?) for full backups? any?
 - Put .zip back in if I can make it behave
 - Zip as compression not archive type at least?  (can't unzip stdin)
 - star? (tar but w/ acl support)
 - smbtar/smbclient?
 - pax (just wraps tar/cpio)?
 - Remote extract/compare/restore
      Just install s/w on client w/remote tape device. need config file
      option
 - When using files
      Make lower numbered level nuke higher ones & rm index?
      Do I really want erase to nuke the archive files?
 - Encryption with gnupg?
 - Gnome driver/configurator utility
      a separate program that just manipulates flexbackup

-------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for cloning restore shell for afio/tar/cpio types)
Use perl readline module
(Maybe a seperate program or module that runs off a list fed to it)

1) do a listing
2) parse & put into data structures
3) mt bsf 1
4) then give a shell w/ all commands from regular dump
5) mark things for extraction
6) reopen archive & extract that list

Help from restore to jog my brain...

        ls [arg] - list directory
        cd arg - change directory
        pwd - print current directory
        add [arg] - add `arg' to list of files to be extracted
        delete [arg] - delete `arg' from list of files to be extracted
        extract - extract requested files
        setmodes - set modes of requested directories
        quit - immediately exit program
        what - list dump header information
        verbose - toggle verbose flag (useful with ``ls'')
        help or `?' - print this list
If no `arg' is supplied, the current directory is used
