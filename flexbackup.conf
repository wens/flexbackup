# Backup type: "afio", "dump", "tar", or "cpio"
$backuptype = "afio";

# List the filesystems you wish to dump when "all" is given
# Just a simple space-separated list
# Remote filesystems should denoted as "host:dir"
#
# Example:
#   $filesystems = "/ /usr /home /usr/local machine1:/usr machine2:/home";
#
$filesystems = "/ goliath:/";

# Device parameters
$device	 = "/dev/nht0";	          # device to dump to (non-rewinding)
$blksize = "64";		  # blocksize (k) to use - default
                                  # for most devices is 10

# Command to use for remote shells (rsh or ssh)
$remoteshell = 'ssh';

# Log files

# Parameters for "afio" only

$afio_verbose  = "true";          # true to print each file as stored

# Parameters for "tar" only
$tar_verbose  = "true";           # true to print each file as stored
$tar_compress = "true";           # true to compress

# Parameters for "cpio" only
$cpio_verbose  = "true";          # true to print each file as stored

                                  # but help "dump" get size estimates

# Set this to "true" if using Linux ftape, false otherwise
# (This will trigger using ftmt rather than mt,
# add vtblc calls for table of contents, etc.)
